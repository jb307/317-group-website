            <h1><strong>SF officials to discuss crime and the city's image</strong></h1>
            <img src="Home Pictures/sf-break-in.jpeg" width="900px">
            <p> Across the country, people are talking about San Francisco's image crisis. The homeless, drugs, an empty downtown and crime. 
                But how do we move beyond these issues and Build a Better Bay Area? That's what ABC7 News will address in a live discussion on Monday with Mayor London Breed, 
                Police Chief Bill Scott and District Attorney Brooke Jenkins.
                <br><br>
                Part of the conversation will be around moving past San Francisco's viral videos
                of smash-and-grab robberies -- rampant shoplifting.
                <br><br>
                Shocking videos of crime after crime have given San Francisco a reputation in recent years.
                <br><br>
                Overall, San Francisco's violent crime rate is low compared to other major cities.
                <br><br>
                In the most recent data from 2022, San Francisco clocked in at 658 violent crimes per 100,000 people. 
                This lags behind New York, Los Angeles and Houston. It's also half the rate of Minneapolis -- a city with less than half the population.
                <br><br>
                Violent crimes include homicide and rape, aggravated assault and robbery. A Robbery is when property is taken from someone through threats or harm.

            <ul>
                <li>Visitors should not leave any luggage in their vehicle. Rental cars are easy to identify and are targeted by thieves</li>
                <li>Popular spots for tourists are also hot sports for car break-ins and robberies.</li>
                <li>Try your best to park in busy areas with other vehicles and people.</li>
                <li>Use common sense, situational awareness and trust your instincts. If a parking location or situation feels unsafe, find an alternative.</li>
