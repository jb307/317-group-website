            <h1><strong>Woman Arrested in San Francisco Bath & Body Works thefts charged with 16 counts</strong></h1>
            <img src="/Pictures/Bath&Body-Works.jpeg" width="900px">
            <p> A San Francisco woman has been arrested and arraigned on more than a dozen charges in connection 
                with a series of commerical burglaries, including the theft of more than $15,000 in goods from a 
                Bath & Body Works store.
                <br><br>
                District Attorney Brooke Jenkins announced that police arrested 30-year-old Carmelita Barela Monday
                without incident in connection with the thefts.
                <br><br>
                "This arrest and prosecution reflects on our on-going commitment to hold repeat offenders accountable
                for their actions," Jenkins said in a statement.
                <br><br>
                Prosecutors allege Barela took part in at least 20 retail thefts between March 30 and October
                29. During that time, Barela and others allegedly stole $15,079.90 in goods from the Bath &
                Body Works at the Westfield San Francisco Centre.
                <br><br>
                Barela was arraigned Thursday on one count of felony organized retail theft, six counts of
                felony grand theft and nine counts of misdemeanor shoplifting. She entered not guilty pleas to
                all charges.
                <br><br>
                Prosecutors said Barela remains in custody without bail. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Monday.
                <br><br>
                Anyone with additional information about the case is urged to contact the San Francisco Police Department's 
                tip line at 415-575-4444 or by texting TIP411, beginning the message with "SFPD".
